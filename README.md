# Toy Language Machine Interpreter

Here are all my lab assingments for the Advanced Methods of Programming course from UBB Cluj

## Project Statement

For this course I had to implement a toy machine language interpreter which could handle some basic statement and expression

For the first labs I had to implement a console application that allows our interpreter to "run" some statements defined before by me

Around the middle of the semester I had to implement the same interpreter but in C#

By the end of the semester I should have a graphical interface that allows step by step execution of before defined statements. It should contain each component used for managing a program state
* Execution Stack
* Symbol Table
* File Table 
* Output List
* Heap
* Barrier Table

The expression that I had to implement are:
* Arithmetic expressions `(/*-+)`
* Boolean expressions `== != > < >= <=`
* Heap expressions `readHeap` or `->`

The statements that I had to implement are:
* Assingment
* Compound
* Fork
* If
* Print
* Switch
* While
* Open file
* Read file
* Close file
* New/alloc statement
* Write heap
* Create cyclic barrier
* Await cyclic barrier
